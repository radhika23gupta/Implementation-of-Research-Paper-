This is the complete implemtation of the research paper into jupyter source file . This is simple python code that include  the use of numpy ,pandas,sklearn and other libraries.This paper  presents a model using a fused machine learning approach for diabetes prediction.
The conceptual framework consists of two types of models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) models. These models analyze the dataset to determine whether a diabetes diagnosis
is positive or negative.
